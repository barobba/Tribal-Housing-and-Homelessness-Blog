# About

*This blog is about my efforts to understand tribal housing and homelessness and explore ideas that might help.*

In the early 2000s (in my early 20s), I spent some time at the Oglala Lakota Housing Authority. At that time, there was a lot of housing activity. Directors decided whether to build houses or buy and ship houses from other places. Local tribal members were hired as builders, plumbers, and electricians.

Fast-forward 20+ years. In 2023, I started helping with an affordable housing project for Indigenous community members living in a tourist city of around 80K residents, where the cost of living was very high. Based on my experience with lean startups, I knew it was essential to learn about the local community and how the nearby tribes were dealing with housing.

I was shocked to discover that tribal housing was at a standstill, at least for the tribal areas I visited. I also learned that the Federal agency tasked with Tribal housing assistance has kept the same budget since it was created in 1996. This was when the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) was created, and its budget has stayed the same ever since. With this act comes regulation, but as its buying power dwindled, its regulations remained unchanged. This is when I knew that Tribal housing and homelessness were part of a larger systemic failure.

Regardless of any outside support, we need creative strategies that address the problems Tribal communities face today.

In 2024, I started meeting with anyone with experience with Tribal housing, including elected representatives, directors, board members, and friends and relatives. The goal was to learn from others about what they were dealing with before coming up with any ideas that might help.

It is also important to note that Indigenous community members are open to solutions that differ from those in the West. My community, for example, actually lived in teepees, yet they are disallowed from being purchased under the NAHASDA regulations. It is not all good or bad, though, and the details can make a difference when trying to come up with practical solutions.
